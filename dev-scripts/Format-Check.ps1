<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Checks script formatting (placeholder).

.DESCRIPTION
    Currently, this script is a placeholder for formatting checks.
    In the future, it could integrate with a formatter like PSScriptAnalyzer's formatting rules.
    For now, it relies on the Lint-Check to catch major style issues.

.EXAMPLE
    .\dev-scripts\Format-Check.ps1

Write-Host "Format check is currently covered by Lint-Check." -ForegroundColor Yellow
